    <h2>Lee Kwang Soo Talks About Balancing Career As An Actor And “Running Man” Star</h2>

    <p>Lee Kwang Soo talked about his career and more in an interview with Esquire Korea!</p>
    <p>At the 56th Baeksang Arts Awards in June, Lee Kwang Soo took home the Best Supporting Actor award for his performance in the film “Inseparable Bros.” Esquire brought up that the judges’ decision had been unanimous, and Lee Kwang Soo replied, “I saw that. I’m so grateful.”</p>
    <p>“To be honest, it didn’t feel real until the ceremony ended,” he continued. “It was a meaningful film to me even without that happening, but when I received the award and congratulations and senior actors told me they enjoyed the movie, it made me think about it once again. Even though audience numbers aren’t everything, I thought to myself after the ceremony ended, ‘It would be great if more people watched ‘Inseparable Bros.’ Of course, I’m grateful to those who’ve seen it already too.”</p>

    <h2>Throwback: 7 Concepts We’d Love To See Again On “Running Man”</h2>
    <h5>Jul 11, 2020</h5>
    <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;"><img src="running.jpeg" style="height: 100%;width: 100%"></div>
    <p>It’s difficult to wrap our heads around the fact that “Running Man” is celebrating it’s 10th anniversary this year! The show first aired on July 11, 2010, and since then, the members have provided us with plenty of laughs for the past 10 years. Yes, there were a few bumps in the way, and the show’s format has changed a few times, but we can’t deny that there’s something comforting in seeing the same set of familiar faces every Sunday night.</p>
    <p>And while the current circumstances (like the members’ physical abilities) mean that “Running Man” might not be able to reproduce the more physically strenuous races from it’s earlier years, we also can’t help but fondly reminisce about some of the concepts/themes that made us fall in love with this show in the first place. Yes, we had series such as the Grasshopper Hunting and Yoomes Bond saga, but there were also some bigger thematic concepts that we rarely see on the show nowadays.</p>
